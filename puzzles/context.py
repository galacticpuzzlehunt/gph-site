# Roughly speaking, this module is most important for implementing "global
# variables" that are available in every template with the Django feature of
# "context processors". But it also does some stuff with caching computed
# properties of teams (the caching is only within a single request (?)). See
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/templates/api/#using-requestcontext

# This object is a request-scoped cache containing data calculated for the

# bar and rendering the puzzles page both need the list of puzzles the current
# team has solved. This object ensures it only needs to be computed once,
# without explicitly having to pass it around from one place to the other.
# The properties here are accessible both from views and from templates. If
# you're adding something with complicated logic, prefer to put most of it in
# a model method and just leave a stub call here.

# you have is an optional team (e.g. you don't know about a specific puzzle, or
# a user who might not be specified by the team). (But TODO(gph): this setup
